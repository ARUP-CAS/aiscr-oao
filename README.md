# Licensed archaeological organizations app

A repo containing code for a Shiny app centered around organizations 
with a licence to conduct an archaeological research in the Czech Republic.

The app is deployed here: <https://oao.aiscr.cz/>.

Currently, the app is in Czech only, sorry.

The app is part of Archaeological information system of the Czech Republic
(<a href="https://www.aiscr.cz">AIS CR</a>).
